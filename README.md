## The BackStory
- This project has allowed us to incorporate everything we have learned in this bootcamp up until now.
- We used HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and React for the front-end while using Express Mongo/Mongoose and JQuery along with AJAX for curl scirpts for the back-end.
- To me it was much more than a project - it was a big learning experience.
- Full Stack with custome API.
